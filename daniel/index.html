            hello there.........Multiplexing: Ports can provide multiple endpoints on a single node. For example, the name 
            on a postal address is a kind of multiplexing, and distinguishes between different recipients of 
            the same location. Computer applications will each listen for information on their own ports, 
            which enables the use of more than one network service at the same time. It is part of the 
            transport layer in the TCP/IP model, but of the session layer in the OSI model.
            Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
            The transport layer in the TCP/IP architecture provides congestion control and reliable 
            delivery, both of which are implemented by TCP, the dominant transport layer protocol on the 
            Internet. TCP has been engineered for many years to efficiently deliver a large bulk of data
